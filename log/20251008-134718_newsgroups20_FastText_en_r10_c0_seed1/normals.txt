server joe english joe trystero art com start lot clients xsession whatever sleep second two launching one changed xclients script logging actually took less time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works warner <unk> imp solbourne com provided good explanation works summarized start server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process touches large number pages process running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps <unk> launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstation limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many

setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suits fonts loading fonts takes time ram minimize number fonts applications use get speed increases load time one simple strategy choose small
