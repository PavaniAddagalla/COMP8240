homosexual male prostitute seems good guess note translation misses strong <unk> term however something fee boswell agree attempt reproduce translation opinion strongest reference homosexuality romans boswell points rom speaks homosexuality something happened people naturally heterosexual result corruption due worshipping false gods one could argue simply example homosexual worshipped false gods

trying define christian homosexuality fits general christian ideals <unk> seeing sexuality mirror relationship god man unfair take paul judgement homosexuality among idolaters use make judgements
