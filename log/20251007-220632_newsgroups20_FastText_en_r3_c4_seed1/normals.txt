strongly felt time come take another step trying dislodge people compound described generally operation would wanted use tear gas tested cause permanent damage adults children would make difficult people stay inside building hoped tear gas would permit come outside told circumstances would people fire shots even fired upon going shoot tear gas armored vehicles would protect would exchange fire fact know awful lot shots fired cult members federal officials shots coming back government side asked number questions first question asked waited seven weeks reasons given following number one limit long federal authorities could maintain limited resources quality intensity coverage experts might needed parts country number two people reviewed never seen case quite like one convinced progress made recently progress going made normal means getting koresh cult members come number three danger something others likely increase decrease passage time number four reason believe children still inside compound abused significantly well forced live unsanitary unsafe conditions reasons wanted move time second question asked attorney general whether given consideration things could wrong evaluated might happen good said fbi personnel scene working convinced chances bad things happening would increase passage time third question asked military consulted soon initial tragedy came light waco first thing asked done obvious typical law enforcement situation military people brought helped analyze situation problems presented asked military consulted attorney general said basic agreement one minor tactical difference opinion fbi military something sides thought overwhelming significance asked questions gotten answers said thought right thing proceed would support stand today president president wait ahead address widespread perception reported widely television radio newspapers trying somehow distance disaster president <unk> reason made public statement yesterday let say reason made public statement yesterday nothing add said literally know rather late day whether anybody still alive actually seen taken hospital taken custody purely simply question waiting events unfold account people speculated one way talked attorney general day action took place talked yesterday called late last night appeared larry king show talked morning president possible president distance things happen federal government control say however frankly surprised would mild word say anyone would suggest attorney general resign religious fanatics murdered applause regret happened possible life control behavior others every circumstance people killed four federal officials line duty heavily armed fired federal officials yesterday repeatedly never fired back everything could avoid loss life made decision immolate regret terribly feel awful children end last comment janet reno talked sunday said want tell believe believe believe move rather wait said children evidence children still abused increasingly unsafe conditions think get easier time passage time take word think things stand assume think mishandled view outcome run patience would really decide way president well think assume exactly announced today fbi done lot things right country long period time fbi found people bombed world trade center <unk> split record time want inquiry analyze steps along way something else known question asked question asked say sure one could done nothing else make outcome come different know want inquiry would like make sure independent law enforcement people political people totally non political outside experts bring bear best evidence unfortunately rise sort fanaticism across world may confront want know whether anything particularly children involved think important recognize wrong <unk> case people killed others killed president options presented resolving situation point february yesterday president well yes got regular reports along way lots options pursued back covered well fbi good job mean fbi authorities pursued number options along way lot early seemed working children got people left one point seemed lines communication opening koresh authorities would say things things began spin downward whether terms happened yesterday conversation attorney general involve options except whether take time present strategy pursuing said wanted thought best way get people compound quickly could kill thought government know children gas masks congressional hearings situation agreement president congress whatever want think important treasury justice departments launch investigation bring outside experts said statement congressional committees want look fully cooperate nothing hide probably well covered operation kind history country ahead sarah two questions want ask first think knew well children gas masks adults children chance gas said lethal dangerous children could survived without gas masks february let back people right practice religion president practicing religion treasury department believed violated federal laws number federal laws president let back answer answer question gas masks except tell whole purpose using tear gas tested convinced kill either child adult would force anybody breathed run outside one things heard want get details know one things speculating today wind blowing fast windows might opened gas might escaped may desired effect also knew sarah underground compound bus buried underground children could sent think hoping much children released immediately outside humane thing would done children would sent someplace could protected terms gas masks learned yesterday ask fact question gas supposed stay active compound longer gas masks work thought even gas masks eventually gas would force nonviolent <unk> circumstance myers last question president still saying could tell whether ever asked janet reno possibility mass suicide learned actual fire explosion went mind horrendous moments president asked janet reno considered worse things could happen said course whole issue suicide raised public debated anyway said people knowledgeable kinds issues concluded greater risk would tomorrow next day day anytime future judgment made whether right wrong course never know happened saw fire saw building burning sick felt terrible immediate concern whether children gotten whether escaping whether inside

dangerous base meaning purely etymology conclude goodbye religious expression based god however since boswell fee niv seem agree homosexual male prostitute seems good guess note translation misses strong <unk> term however something fee boswell agree attempt reproduce translation opinion strongest reference homosexuality romans boswell points rom speaks homosexuality something happened people naturally heterosexual result corruption due worshipping false gods one could argue simply example homosexual worshipped false gods would also fall degradation perhaps become heterosexual however find argument somewhat forced fact homosexual readers seriously proposed paul meant however convinced rom sufficient create law homosexuality christians paul describing rom homosexuality among christians
