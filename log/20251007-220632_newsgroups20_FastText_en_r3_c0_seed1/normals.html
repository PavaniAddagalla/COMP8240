xsession whatever sleep second two launching one changed xclients script logging actually took less time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works warner <unk> imp solbourne com provided good explanation works summarized start server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process touches large number pages process running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps <unk> launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstation limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space

side benefit server may start <unk> quicker since load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also drawbacks application interested load additional file every
